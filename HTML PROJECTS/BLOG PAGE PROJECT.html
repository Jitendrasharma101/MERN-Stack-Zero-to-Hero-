<p style="margin: 40px;">Sustainable living and Ayurveda are not unknown terms. In fact, they have both been prominently discussed, especially in recent times. What is perhaps lesser known is the fact that they are both intricately linked. So much so that one often precedes the other.

    How? Let’s delve right into the wonderful way in which Ayurveda acts as a basis for achieving a sustainable way of life.
    
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin:40px"> What is sustainable living?</h2>
    <p style="margin: 40px;"> Sustainable living is all about a lifestyle that aims to reduce the impact of our habits and actions on the community and environment; while at the same time adopting practices that reduce environmental damage as well as our carbon footprint.

        In a nut shell, sustainable living emphasises the impact of our roles on the health of the world and promotes an environmentally conscious lifestyle.</p>
    <h2 style="margin: 40px;">How are Ayurveda and sustainable living connected?</h2>    
    <p style="margin: 40px;">While Ayurveda is often viewed as a system of medicine and healing that focuses on the mind and body, it is so much more than that. Ayurvedic philosophy essentially emphasises on finding balance within ourselves and the nature around us.

        Ayurveda provides you with tools and guidelines that help you live in harmony with nature. Moreover, an Ayurvedic lifestyle means that your day is structured around seasonal elements, as well as the Earth’s natural circadian rhythm. This includes regulating your sleep schedule to wake up with the sun, eating natural, unprocessed foods, and practicing mindful living.
        
        The simple habits and practices of an Ayurvedic lifestyle enable you to be in sync with your environment, thereby promoting a healthier, and more sustainable existence.</p>
        <h2 style="margin:40px"> How can you practice sustainable living with Ayurvedic principles?</h2>
        <p style="margin:40px"> Because sustainable living is such an ingrained part of Ayurvedic philosophy, you may not even notice how small changes can allow you to create a deep and lasting impact on your own health, and the health of the planet.

            Some of the simple measures that bring you closer towards living your most sustainable life include:
        </p>
        <ol style="margin: 40px;">
            <li> <h3 > Following an Ayurvedic diet</h3></li>
            <p style="margin:40 px"> What is an Ayurvedic diet? An Ayurvedic diet basically is a meal plan that is based around your specific body type or dosha. It also follows the cues of Earth, with a focus on eating seasonally, locally produced, and organically grown foods; which is healthier for you as well as for the planet.

                An Ayurvedic diet is largely composed of natural, wholesome, and unprocessed foods. Ayurvedic herbs, spices, and greens play a large role in balancing the diet, while also stimulating healing and digestion.
                
                Practicing mindfulness when eating, eating regular meals, and eating in moderation are also important aspects of following an Ayurvedic diet.</p>
            <li> <h3 > Following an Ayurvedic lifestyle</h3></li>
            <p style="margin:40px">As mentioned before, an Ayurvedic lifestyle is all about finding balance. This can be achieved through small but important changes in your daily routine that directly lead to a boost in health, peace, and vitality. Some of these lifestyle changes include:
            <ul  style="list-style-type:disc;" style="margin: 40px;"><li>Waking up early and following a consistent morning schedule</li>
            <li>Staying hydrated</li>
            <li>Getting adequate rest</li>
            <li>Practicing yoga and meditation</li>
            <li>Exercising regularly</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Quite simply, it is not rocket science, but tiny measures that create a huge impact on our health, productivity, and the environment.
    </p>
    <li> <h3 > Healing oneself through Ayurvedic medicine</h3>
    <p>One of the biggest causes and consequences of an unsustainable life is the dependence on drugs and medication. While they may be helpful and even effective in treating certain conditions; their efficacy is not exactly long lasting.

        Ayurvedic medicine on the other hand treats not only the symptoms of the disease, but the root cause of an ailment. Its holistic approach combines curative and preventive therapies to formulate a treatment plan that is unique to each individual. In this way, a specific treatment plan is created that is both incredibly effective as well as enduring.
        
        A few of these renowned Ayurvedic remedies, therapies, and practices, which are easy to integrate into your daily schedule, include:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;" style="margin: 40px;">
        <li>Consuming a warm glass of lemon and honey water first thing in the morning</li>
        <li>Incorporating spices such as ginger, turmeric and cumin to boost immunity</li>
        <li>Using adaptogens to naturally increase energy levels</li>
        <li>Daily meditation for stress relief and mindfulness</li>
        <li>Abhyanga with dosha-specific oils for its incredible benefits</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li> <h3 > Recycling and waste management</h3>
        <p>
            Naturally, reducing the waste we produce, and its responsible disposal, is one of the best ways to ensure the health and sustainability of our planet. We have all heard about the 5 R’s; namely refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle. But how do we go about implementing these?
        </p>
        <p>Here are some measures you can take today:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;" style="margin: 40px;">
            <li>Eliminate the use of single-use plastics and polythene products</li>
            <li>Go paperless</li>
            <li>Donate anything useful that you no longer need</li>
            <li>Compost your organic waste</li>
            <li>Keep separate bins for recyclable items</li>
            <li>Upcycle!</li>
            <li>Carry reusable water bottles and coffee mugs </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In reality, there are countless ways in which we can make a big difference. Waste management helps us be mindful about this impact and helps us maintain a balance to offset our negative influence while creating a positive change.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 style="margin:40px"> Conclusion</h2>
